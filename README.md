# DigiSparkMouseJigglerTV

## Introduction
**DigiSparkMouseJigglerTV** is a DIY (Do-It-Yourself) project that utilizes a DIGISPARK USB device to create a mouse jiggler, primarily for TVs and other similar devices. The main feature of this jiggler is its ability to hide the mouse cursor and prevent the activation of screensavers, ensuring uninterrupted viewing or usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. This software is essential for programming the Digispark device.

### Installation Steps

5. **Write and Upload the Code:**
   - Use the provided script to program your Digispark device.
   ```cpp
   #include <DigiMouse.h>

   void setup() {
     DigiMouse.begin();
   }
   
   void loop() {
     while(true) {
       DigiMouse.move(100, 0, 0); // Move 2px right
       DigiMouse.delay(10000);    // Delay for 10 seconds
     }
   }
